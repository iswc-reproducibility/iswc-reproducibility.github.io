### Best Practices
A good source of dos and donâ€™ts can be found in the
[ICDE 2008 tutorial by Ioana Manolescu and Stefan Manegold](http://pages.saclay.inria.fr/ioana.manolescu/SLIDES/ManolescuManegoldICDE2008.pdf) (and a subsequent [EDBT 2009 tutorial](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/431423/filename/Tutorial.pdf)).

They include a road-map of tips and tricks on how to organize and present code that performs experiments, so that an outsider can repeat them. In addition, the ICDE 2008 tutorial discusses good practices on experiment design more generally, addressing, for example, how to chose which parameters to vary and in what domain.
