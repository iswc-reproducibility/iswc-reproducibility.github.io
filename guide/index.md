title: Reproducibility Guidelines
layout: single

Every research paper is different and the steps to achieve reproducibility may vary, but here we provide general guidance and links to other resources that you can consider to make your research reproducibile.

In some cases, the reproducers from the [Programme Committee](/pc/) can simply re-run software (e.g. re-run some existing benchmark). In other cases, getting the raw data for an experiment may require special data sharing agreements. Then, it would be ideal if you could provide some simulated datasets to run the evaluation. 

# Environment

Authors should explicitly specify the Operating System and tools that should be installed as the environment for running the software. Such specification should include dependencies with specific hardware features (e.g. 25 GB of RAM are needed).
